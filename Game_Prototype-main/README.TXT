PROJECT TITLE: Portal Flight W.I.P
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: Game Prototype
DATE:4/11/2025
HOW TO START THIS PROJECT: If you are not on splash screen, please do so.
AUTHORS: Laura, Manal and Joeffrey
USER INSTRUCTIONS:
-Movement:
	-w = jump
	-a = move left
	-d = move right

Once in the lobby after clicking play in the menu, move to the portal and wait until you get teleported. 
To beat the game for now, you will have to survive the attacks from the fireballs for a certain amount of time.
If you lose, reset the world since there is no implementation for a "back" or "restart" button yet.
